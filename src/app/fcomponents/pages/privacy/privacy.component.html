        <div class="s2">Learnspace.co.nz is owned and operated by Proprius Ltd, Wellington. ("Learnspace," "we," or "us"). We provide this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that apply to our
          Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. By using the Learnspace web application service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this statement.</div>

          <div class="m2">Personally Identifiable Information</div>
          <div class="s2"> We collect Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) only when you provide such information directly to us in connection with the Service. We ask for Personally Identifiable Information when you register for a User account with the
            Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We may receive
            Personally Identifiable Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access Learnspace websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Google, etc., that third party may pass certain information
            about your use of its service to Learnspace. This information could include any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always
            review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our websites or Service. "Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that may be used to identify
            an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information. By using paid aspects of the Service, you may be required to share billing and
            payment information with a third-party payment processor, and you expressly agree to the use of your billing and payment information by any such third-party payment processor.
